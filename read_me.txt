- Conducted time series analysis on Jena Climate dataset, employing LSTM model for forecasting.
- Explored data using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, ensuring dataset integrity.
- Prepared data by dividing into smaller time periods, creating additional features, and standardizing.
- Built LSTM model architecture, trained with Adam optimizer, and evaluated performance using R-squared score (R^2 = 0.8475).
